“我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀。 原来我们不是顾念所见的，乃是顾念所不见的；因为所见的是暂时的，所不见的是永远的。”
‭‭哥林多后书‬ ‭4‬:‭17‬-‭18‬ ‭CUNPSS-神‬‬

“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”
‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭4‬:‭17‬-‭18‬ ‭KJV‬‬
